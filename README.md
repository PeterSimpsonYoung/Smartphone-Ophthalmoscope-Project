# Smartphone-Ophthalmoscope-Project
MECH3921/AMME5921 - Biomedical Design and Technology
The aim of this project is to develop a low-cost, open source platform for screening and diagnosis of common eye diseases. The platform replaces traditional ophthalmoscopes and slit lamp devices with a simple and easy to use device, and uses cloud-based machine learning to aid the clinician.

The platform will serve two distinct functions. First, the device will be able to photograph the patient’s retina and determine the likelihood of the patient having glaucoma. Second, the device will be able to use the slit lamp method to image the anterior chamber of the eye, and infer the likelihood of the patient having anterior uveitis.

The input must contains 10 images (to increase accuracy, the result would depend on the overall result of all 10 images)
